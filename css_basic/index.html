            <h2>About the book</h2>
            <p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book written by Robert T. Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It advocates the
                importance of financial literacy (financial education), financial independence and building wealth

                increasing one's financial intelligence (financial IQ). <a

            </a>
            <p>Rich Dad Poor Dad is written in the style of a set of parables based on Kiyosaki's life.[1] The titular
                "rich dad" is his best friend's father who accumulated wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy
                investing, while the "poor dad" is claimed to be Kiyosaki's own father who he says worked hard all his
                life but never obtained financial security.</p>

            <h2>Summarized Lessons from "Rich Dad Poor Dad"</h2>

            <h3>The Two Dads</h3>
            <p>Robert Kiyosaki's father, the "poor dad," was a well-educated but financially struggling government
                worker. In contrast, his friend's father, the "rich dad," was a successful businessman who acquired
                wealth through real estate investments.
            </p>

            <h3>Assets vs. Liabilities</h3>
            <p>Rich Dad taught Robert that assets, not liabilities, generate wealth. Assets put money in your pocket,
                while liabilities take money out. Rich Dad's assets, like rental properties, produced passive income,
                allowing him to build wealth.
            </p>

            <h3>The Poor Dad Mindset</h3>
            <p>Poor Dad, on the other hand, believed that a good job and a high salary were the keys to financial
                security. He worked hard but remained stuck in a cycle of debt and financial struggle.
            </p>

            <h3>Financial Education</h3>
            <p>Rich Dad emphasized the importance of financial education, teaching Robert about cash flow, accounting,
                and investing. He encouraged Robert to think differently about money and to develop financial literacy.
            </p>

            <h3>Pay Yourself First</h3>
            <p>One of Rich Dad's most valuable lessons was the concept of paying yourself first. He taught Robert to set
                aside a portion of his income for investments before paying taxes, bills, or expenses.
            </p>

            <h3>Embracing Risk</h3>
            <p>Rich Dad also stressed the importance of taking calculated risks and facing fears. He encouraged Robert
                to step out of his comfort zone and embrace failure as a learning opportunity.
            </p>

            <h3>Mindset Matters</h3>
            <p>The book highlights the contrast between the two fathers' mindsets, illustrating how beliefs and
                attitudes shape financial decisions. Rich Dad's wealth-building strategies and financial wisdom offer
                valuable lessons for anyone seeking financial freedom.
            </p>

            <h3>Applying Rich Dad's Principles</h3>
            <p>By applying Rich Dad's principles, Robert Kiyosaki achieved financial success and became a successful
                entrepreneur, investor, and author. The book inspires readers to rethink their financial beliefs and
                adopt a wealth-building mindset.</p>
